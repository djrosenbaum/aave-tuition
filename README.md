**Spark Hackathon Concept** - Earn interest on your tuition toward future University semesters

Project submission to [The Spark University Hackathon](https://medium.com/encode-club/announcing-the-spark-university-hackathon-df4a2dded845) hosted by [En[code] Club](https://www.encode.club/)

Another hackathon, another idea. Looking over the sponsors [Aave](https://app.aave.com/?referral=76) which I have been pronouncing *ahh vay* caught my attention. If you are not familiar yet, [Aave](https://app.aave.com/?referral=76) provides a money market protocol on ethereum's network for borrowers and lenders. At present, the smart contracts powering Aave's money market are managing over $100 million USD.

At the most basic level there are borrowers and lenders. Lenders deposit tokens such as [DAI](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/DAI?pool=Aave&referral=76) into a pool to earn interest.
Borrowers stake one token in order to borrow another token with interest that goes to the lenders.

For this hackathon the team imagined a University of the future. A University which transparently stakes student tuition into a money market using Aave's protocol. All interest earned from a student's tuition can be collected by the student upon receiving their graduation diploma.
